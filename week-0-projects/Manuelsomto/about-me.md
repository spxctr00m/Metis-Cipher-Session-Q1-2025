# Introduction
Hi, I'm Emmanuel Irechukwu, a self-taught backend developer with a focus on Node.Js and Express frameworks. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and their application in the real world.

## Expectations
I joined this program to enhance my skills in Web3 development, network and collaborate with other developers in the space.

### Experience So Far
So far, the program has been exciting. Learning GitHub in Week 0 has been an interesting one. Though I have some knowledge of github, this will be the first time I will be contributing and also using it to collaborate.
